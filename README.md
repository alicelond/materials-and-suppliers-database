This repository refers to the the development of a database that contains information regarding materials, their suppliers and also their acoustical characteristics.

Iniatially, the development took place on VBA programming where I created a form, and automated the data insertion on an Excel file. With this, the user is able to add information without having to manually do it on Excel.

Nowadays, I'm devoloping a Python script where I will try to extract information from PDF files, and then further add this into the Excel file previously made.

Both of these features are going to be available. If the user wants to add information manually, they will be able to use the floating window that will be shown to them. Otherwise, they will also be able to just add the path of the PDF file that they want to extract information from.
